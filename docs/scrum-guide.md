# Scrum Guide

## Overview
We follow the Scrum framework to manage our project. Scrum allows us to organize our work into iterative sprints, ensuring frequent delivery and continuous improvement.

### Scrum Roles
- **Product Owner**: Responsible for the product backlog, prioritizing work, and making key decisions.
- **Scrum Master**: Ensures that Scrum practices are followed, helps remove blockers, and facilitates meetings.
- **Development Team**: Responsible for delivering the work defined in the sprint.

### Artifacts
- **Product Backlog**: A prioritized list of features, bugs, and technical tasks.
- **Sprint Backlog**: The work selected for the current sprint from the product backlog.
- **Increment**: The working product after the sprint, which includes all the completed work.

### Scrum Events
- **Sprint Planning**: At the beginning of each sprint, we plan the work to be done during that sprint.
- **Daily Standups**: A short, daily meeting where team members report on their progress and any blockers.
- **Sprint Review**: At the end of the sprint, we review the work completed and demonstrate new features to the stakeholders.
- **Sprint Retrospective**: After each sprint, we reflect on the process and look for ways to improve.
