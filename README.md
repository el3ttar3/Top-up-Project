## Technical Approach

### Frontend

## Challenges and Mitigation

One of the main challenges anticipated is delivering high-quality video content efficiently to a global audience. Video streaming requires significant bandwidth, which can lead to loading issues and increased costs.

### Solutions:
- A **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** will be utilized to distribute content globally, minimizing latency.
- **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming** will optimize video quality based on the user's internet connection, ensuring smooth playback across various devices.

We are also mindful of potential challenges regarding the database and the implementation of a secure payment gateway, which will be addressed during development.
